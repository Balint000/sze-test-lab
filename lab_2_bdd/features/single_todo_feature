Feature: Retrieve a single To-Do item
As a user of the API,
I want to be able to retrieve a specific to do item by its ID,
so that I can view its details.

```python
  Scenario: A to-do item exists
    Given the API has a to-do with id 2 and task "Build a Flask API"
    When the user requests the to-do with id 2
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain the details of the to-do with id 2

    Then the response status code should be 404
    And the response should contain a "not found" error message
